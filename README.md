This project is a result of the #ReloadlyXFlutterwave Hackathon. Working with a group of four, Product Manager, Product Designer, Backend Engineer and a Frontend Engineer.

## What is Plant iT!?

**Plant iT!** is a web application that allows users to plant trees in their neighbourhood at the touch of a button. We aim to provide you with a safe and secure 🔐 way to plant trees in your neighbourhood.

## How it works

We can get you started in these short steps

- Sign up for an account
- Select the number of trees
- Select an area where you want to plant them
- Select a tree type
- Click a button to complete the donation.

## How to benefit 💚

We are not here to scare you to a doom that is seems distant, but our planet 🌍 really needs urgent attention and we are here to help.

At the heart of this, we aim to make the world a better place by planting trees in the places that need it most, like the semi arid areas of Northern Nigeria 🇳🇬.

While doing this, earn points you can use to redeem rewards 🎁 🎁 ie. airtime top ups, data bundles and gift cards.
